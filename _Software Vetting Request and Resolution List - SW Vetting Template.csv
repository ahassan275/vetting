ECNO-Based Checklist: (adapted from the Student Digital Privacy Standard criteria used by ECNO for vetting for Education Applications),,,,
"Purpose: To ensure that web apps, software and online services used in Ontario school boards adhere to uncompromising high standards of protection, these criteria are based on data protections for end users (e.g. children) endorsed by regulators and experts across North America and the European Union. 
This standard is intended to shift the data protection landscape and raise the bar for end-user (e.g. student) digital privacy in Ontario School Districts.",,,,
